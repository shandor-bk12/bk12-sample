# Sample PowerShell script for Blackbaud K12 "ON" products API that
# uses the acadmeics/enrollment API call

$schoolWebsite = "https://my_school.myschoolapp.com"  # website used to login to the "ON" products
$apiUser = "my_username"
$apiPassword = "my_password"

$sectionId = 2567108  # You can get this ID from the /academics/section/ API

# First, we use the login method to get a authentication token using our username and password
$response = Invoke-RestMethod "$schoolWebsite/api/authentication/login?username=$apiUser&password=$apiPassword&format=json"

if($response.Token) { # Did we get a token in our response?
	$token = $response.Token
	$response = Invoke-RestMethod "$schoolWebsite/api/academics/enrollment/?t=$token&sectionId=		$sectionId&format=json"
	$response | Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation -Encoding ascii -Path "C:/tmp/sections.csv"

	Invoke-Item "C:\tmp\sections.csv"
}



# Rather than using the GET method, you can call this API with POST to enroll
# students or DELETE to drop students from an enrollment.  Sample code for these
# methods coming soon.
